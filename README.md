#Event_Manager

This program parses .csv database, cleans records, creates and writes to new files, and calculates peak hour and day with the highest number of registrants in a dummy data set.

###The techniques practiced:

* File input and output
* Reading data from CSV files
* String manipulation
* Accessing Sunlightâ€™s Congressional API through the Sunlight Congress gem
